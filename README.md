# AdvancedR3: Reproducible Research in R

This project is part of the course "Advanced - Reproducible Research in
R"

# Brief description of folder and file contents

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: Processed raw data
-   `doc/`: Documents and other stuff related to the final article
-   `R/`: Custom functions or scripts

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_deps()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.
